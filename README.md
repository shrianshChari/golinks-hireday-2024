# Golinks Hireday 2024 Project

Given to me during Golinks Hireday, which is a event where people at Golinks give us a full-stack application (whose instructions are in [this repository](./export.pdf)), we build it, and then present it to them. Within the directories are the frontend and backend.

No, I did not get hired. It is here to demonstrate my ability to be a full-stack developer, as I can develop frontend applications with React and backend applications with Express. I used TypeScript throughout the entire application.

### Frontend

Was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager.

Set up the application: `yarn install`

To run this application: `yarn run dev`

### Backend

An [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager.

Set up the application: `yarn install`

To run this application: `yarn run all`
